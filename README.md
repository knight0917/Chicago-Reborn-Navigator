# Chicago Reborn: Interactive Keyword Map

**Chicago Reborn** is an interactive web visualization designed to accompany the ArcGIS StoryMap project: ["Chicago Reborn: Structural Revolution after the Great Fire"](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/50469a19de2c4a03b3008476ac062de3).

This application serves as a non-linear navigation tool, allowing users to explore key historical themes—The Great Fire, Architecture, and Urban Evolution—via an immersive, interactive map interface.

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Cartography:** A drag-and-zoom interface representing a stylized map of Chicago (3000x2000px canvas).
- **Thematic Visualization:**
  - 🔥 **Event (Red):** The Great Fire, destruction, and crisis points.
  - 🏛️ **Architecture (Gold):** Key landmarks like The Rookery, Palmer House, and Willis Tower.
  - 🏙️ **City (Blue):** Urban planning, public spaces, and the "Chicago Loop."
- **Atmospheric Design:** "Dark Mode" aesthetic with glowing neon accents, animated embers, and a stylized Chicago River.
- **Deep Linking:** Every pin on the map links directly to the specific timestamp or section within the main StoryMap presentation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Core structure and styling.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first styling for the UI HUD and overlay components.
- **Vanilla JavaScript:** Custom engine for map panning (drag), zooming (wheel/buttons), and SVGs rendering.
- **SVG Graphics:** Used for the Chicago River path and connecting narrative lines.

## 📦 How to Use

1.  **Open the Map:** simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2.  **Navigate:**
    - **Pan:** Click and drag anywhere on the map background to move.
    - **Zoom:** Use your mouse wheel or the **+ / -** buttons in the bottom right corner.
